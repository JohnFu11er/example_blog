YAML is a useful file type for applications where data is being stored or transmitted. It is used in the construction of Ansible playbooks:

{% highlight yaml %}

  - name: Some Awesome Play
    hosts: routers
    connection: network_cli
    gather_facts: no

    tasks:
      - name: Retreive Running Config
        ios_commands:
          Commands: show run
        register: output
      
      - name: Show Running Config
        debug:
          var: output.stdout

{% endhighlight %}
